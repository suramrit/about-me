#fmt.Println("Hello there!")

Hello! Im Suramrit. A systems/software engineer. I currently live Kirkland, WA with my wonderful wife. 
When I am not building and testing software and networks, I like to indulge with a vast variety of interests and passions. 

Here are some things that I always aspire to be better at : 
- Algorithm and Data Structures (Thats the bread and butter)
- Building Scalable systems(Some more bread and butter) 
- Chess (currently aspiring for a 1500 FIDE rating)
- Science Education (Teaching Science and programming is fun!)
- Classical Music (Learning a violin is hard) 
- Astrophotography (Who knew trying to sit still for hours would be so much fun)
- Amatuer astronomy (I know a few constellations and celestial bodies) 

Although I have had an unconvential journey in software engineering, that has not stopped me from pursuing opportunities in core distributed system engineering related roles. 

If you or your organization are looking for a dedicated software engineer with a passion in systems engineering, please fell free to reach out to me at
