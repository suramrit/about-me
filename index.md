A systems/software engineer. I currently live in Kirkland, WA with my wonderful wife. 

I am currently ramping up my interview prepartion as I am pursuing opportunities in core distributed systems and software engineering related roles. 

When I am not building and testing software and networks, I like to indulge with a vast variety of interests and passions. 

Here are some things that I always aspire to be better at : 
- Algorithm and Data Structures (Thats the bread and butter)
- Building Scalable systems(Some more bread and butter) 
- Chess (hope to have a 2000 FIDE rating)
- Science Education (Teaching Science and programming is fun!)
- Classical Music (Learning a violin is hard) 
- Astrophotography (Who knew trying to sit still for hours would be so much fun)
- Amatuer astronomy (I know a few constellations and celestial bodies) 

If you or your organization are looking for a dedicated software engineer with a passion in systems engineering, please fell free to reach out to me at
